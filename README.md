# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in web development and system design. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with a wide variety of languages and technologies â€” from JavaScript, PHP, and Python to my current favorite and main language: **Go**.

Iâ€™m passionate about open source and always looking for ways to contribute to the community. I enjoy building tools that are fast, clean, and actually useful.
